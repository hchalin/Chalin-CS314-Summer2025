## My Contributions  
At the start of the project, our group had a slow beginning with limited communication and no clear plan. To help provide structure, I created an outline and class-based system so new features could be added in a *“plug-and-play”* manner. This ensured that as story points were assigned, members could integrate their work more easily.  

During the second week, it became clear that movement was the critical first feature. After several check-ins on progress, I stepped in and implemented the movement system myself. I made sure it passed all test cases and provided a working base ship for the team to build on. This gave everyone a stable foundation for adding mechanics.

I maintained consistent communication with Lex to align our story points, but group coordination overall was inconsistent. At times, my code was overwritten due to missed updates in Discord, which slowed progress.

## Assigned Story Points  
My primary assigned feature was implementing the **Sensors**, followed later by the **Landing/Orbit** system (though I was not able to fully implement the latter). The Sensors ended up requiring significantly more work than expected, especially due to integration challenges with other systems.   

I collaborated closely with Lex offline to ensure our code worked well together. As part of this, I refactored the provided **control panel code** into a class-based structure. This allowed team members to “plug in” their features through a consistent interface. For example, if someone wanted to add a ship control mechanic, they could simply connect it to the control panel class. This design made integration smoother and more manageable.

## Lessons Learned  
- Clear communication is essential for coordinating responsibilities.  
- A flexible design (like the class-based system) helps when collaboration is uneven.  
- Proactively stepping in to implement blockers can keep the project moving.  
- Story points often take more time and integration effort than expected.  
- Make sure everyone understands on how the team is expected to use version control for their implementations. 
  Instead of everyone working of main.

## Suggestions for Improvement  
Better communication would have made the project run much smoother. Even simple updates—such as letting the group know if progress was delayed—would have helped. If someone couldn’t complete a feature in a timely manner, reassigning it to another member with more availability would have prevented bottlenecks.
